# Machine Coding Mini Projects #
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects commonly encountered in machine coding rounds of technical interviews. Each project is designed to assess problem-solving skills, code structure, and best practices in software development.

## Structure ##
Each mini-project has its own dedicated repository within this parent repository. You can explore them individually to understand their implementation. The mini - projects are stored as submodules in git. Hence their deployments are independent of each other.

## Purpose ##
* To practice and improve coding skills for machine coding interview rounds.  
* To learn best practices in structuring and optimizing code.  
* To enhance problem-solving abilities through real-world coding challenges.  
## How to Use ##
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the desired project.  
2. Follow the setup instructions provided in each project's README.  
3. Implement and optimize the solution based on coding best practices.  


Feel free to contribute by adding new projects or improving existing implementations. Happy coding!
